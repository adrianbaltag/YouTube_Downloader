# YouTube Downloader

This is a Python app, and its sole purpose is to help you download YouTube videos on your PC.
It is very easy to use and will help you save your favorite videos in a chosen file(by youüòé) on your PC.



## Situation

## Task
The project folder structure is as followed:
- gitignore
