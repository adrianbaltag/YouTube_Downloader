# YouTube Downloader

This is a Python app, and its sole purpose is to help you download YouTube videos on your PC.
It is very easy to use and will help you save your favorite videos in a chosen file(by youüòé) on your PC.



## Motivation

I created this app, as my first Python script, to help myself to learn Python, save my favorite videos from YouTube in different folders on my PC(related to different topics interested in), become a better developer, and have all my favorite resources at hand.
